# PasswordWebcam

A simple Windows Forms app that monitors the Security log for failed logins. A photo from the selected webcam will be taken on a failed login event and saved to the folder specified in the application window (default: My Pictures) under the name WebcamPassword_Intruder_date.png where date is the current date-time in the format yyyyMMddTHHMMss. 

[Latest release](https://github.com/mculig/PasswordWebcam/releases/download/v1/WebcamPassword.v1.zip)

The app **requires** .NET 4.5.2 or newer to run, tested on Win 10 only. Sorry :)
